### Here's some code

It's c++ code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
  std::cout << argv[0];
  return 0;
}
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/w00ik3/w00ik3.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
